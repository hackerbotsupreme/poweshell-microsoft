# what is control panel 

# A control panel is a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides access to various system settings and features on a computer. It allows users to configure and manage various aspects of the computer's hardware and software, including user accounts, network settings, display settings, sound settings, and more. Control panels are typically included with operating systems such as Windows, MacOS, and Linux, and can also be found on other devices such as printers and routers. In general, a control panel serves as a centralized location for users to access and adjust the settings of their system.





# more on above question

# Sure, here's some more information about control panels:

# Control panels are designed to make it easier for users to manage the settings and preferences of their computers or other devices. They typically provide an organized and user-friendly interface that presents all available options in a logical and intuitive way. Users can usually navigate through the various settings and options using a series of menus, tabs, and buttons.

# Different operating systems and devices may have slightly different control panel interfaces and options. For example, the Windows Control Panel includes options for managing hardware, network and internet settings, security and privacy settings, and more. Meanwhile, the MacOS System Preferences panel includes options for managing display and sound settings, user accounts, and other system preferences.

# In addition to the standard control panels provided by operating systems and devices, there are also many third-party control panels available. These may be designed for specific purposes such as gaming or audio production, or they may provide more advanced features or customization options than the built-in control panels.

# Overall, control panels are an important tool for managing the settings and preferences of a computer or other device. They allow users to customize their system to meet their individual needs and preferences, and to troubleshoot issues or problems that may arise.

# Sure, here are some additional use cases of control panels for security:

# Encryption: The control panel can provide options for managing encryption settings on your device. You can set up encryption for specific folders, files, or drives, and configure advanced settings such as key strength and algorithm type. This can help protect sensitive data from unauthorized access or theft.

# Device Drivers and Firmware Updates: The control panel can also provide options for managing device drivers and firmware updates. Keeping these up to date can help improve security and fix vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

# Backup and Restore: The control panel may also include options for managing backup and restore settings. This can help you protect your data from loss or corruption due to security threats such as ransomware or hardware failures.

# Remote Access: Some control panels provide options for managing remote access to your device. This can include options for enabling or disabling remote desktop, setting up remote access credentials, or configuring firewall settings to restrict access to specific IP addresses.

# Event Logs and Diagnostics: Finally, the control panel may provide options for managing event logs and diagnostics. This can be useful for monitoring and troubleshooting security issues or system errors that may arise. You can view logs of system activity, as well as set up alerts or notifications for specific events.

# Overall, the control panel provides a variety of options and settings for managing the security of your device. By using these tools, you can help protect your data, prevent unauthorized access, and keep your system running smoothly.

# what is powershell?
# powershell is a task automation framework built  on .net framework to provide a uniform command line experience to administrators and other folks who wantsto control and configure the system .
# uniform command access 

#powershell commands provide werb-noun systax.
# example :
# getprocess 
# stop-process
# get-content 
# start process 




# uniform access using drive 
# uniform method to access  registry , environmentvariables or drives apart from that environment variables are listed as drives ..
# get-psdrive would list the real and virtual drives which powershell uses .


#also in the powershell the way we handle everything so same thing has been extrapoleted for handling registry operation . 




# powershell command types 
# powershell command or scripts could be of the following types :
# ther is a severel types of commands which powershell follows or which can be used .
# Alias ( alias is a short form of some other command ) 
# Cmdlet(cmdlets are actual commands of powershell its a lightweight command basically , which does some particular function which also utilizes some functions of .net ) 
# functions (again you can write your own funtions in powershell)
# scripts (also your can write your full-blown scripts to automate tasks )
# executable or binary which are present on the path .



#pipelining in powershell 
# pipelining in powersheell is a concept to send the output of a  cmdlet/function using |.unlike unix the 
# data passed in the pipes are objects rather than a text .
#you can think of it like the output of one command becomes the input for another command .



# about powershell remember that there is two things one is powershell ISE(integrated scripting engine 
# so here can write a script and can have some help also ) and the other one is powesrshell terminal .
# and yeah , you may find some differen versions of them based on 32 or 64 bit and the update versions .


#lets see the first command is get-process .(it will list out processes present in the system)
# and if i look here when i saay powershell treats as an oject .
# so which means that there is this object member and we can list out what are the different properties or or methods we can use .
#methods are like a function you can call , properties are like an attribute of an object.
# so from the list i can see there is a property threads.
# so i can say  (get-process ).Threds 
# so it will list out all the threads for all the process.
# that's why we can say its an object oriented bcz we deal with objects .


# for allias , lets say you are used to dir . 
# how dir works . htere is a command called get-Alias you can list out in the sysytem .
# so if you type --> get-alias -name dir 
# if i want to sort on the based of a handles .
# i will say --> get-process| sort-object  -property handles  
# here the result of the get-process will be input for sort-object . -process is the parameter to sort in ascending manner .
# you can also do it in a descending way --> get-process| sort-object  -property handles  -descending 
# or you can also do it for the process name .
#get-process| sort-object  -property processname   -descending 



# one more command 
# get-Psdrive 
# i was saying that there is a uniform way in which things is excessive that are accessible .
# so if you see in result , i have c drive listed as a physical drive . 
# but here you will not ony see the physical drive but also the drive that are created by system and you will see one environment variable drive and if you have created any virtual box then you will also see a drive for that .
# so say we need to list all the files and folders in some directory or somewhere , so lets suppose 
#list out all the files or folders in some directory or folders  in c drive .
# i will say --> Get-Childitem c:
# for environment variable --> Get-children env:



# and the name is uniform access because the way we can work with environment variable we can 
# also work with registry and also with drive .




# get-process
#(get-process)|get-member # this will list out all the different properties , function , methods we can use .
# (get-process).threds
# get-alias
# get-alias -name dir 
# get-alias -name ps
#get- process
# get-process | sort-object -property handles
# get-process | sort-object -property handles -descending 
# get-process | sort-object -property processname  -descending 
# get-psdrive 
# get-childItem c:
# get-childItem env:
#
