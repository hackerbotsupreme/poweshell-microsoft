9. can be set with group policy 


                        what is the difference between allsigned and remote signed in powershell 
In PowerShell, there are several execution policies that determine which scripts can be run on a system. Two of these execution policies are "AllSigned" and "RemoteSigned".

"RemoteSigned" is an execution policy that allows scripts to run if they are locally created and signed by a trusted publisher or if they are remotely downloaded and signed by a trusted publisher. This execution policy is useful for running scripts that are created by a trusted source but downloaded from the internet or other untrusted sources.

"AllSigned" is an execution policy that requires all scripts to be digitally signed by a trusted publisher before they can be executed on the system, regardless of whether they are local or remote. This execution policy provides a higher level of security and is typically used in environments where security is a top priority.

In summary, "RemoteSigned" allows locally created scripts and remotely downloaded scripts signed by a trusted publisher to be executed, while "AllSigned" requires all scripts to be digitally signed by a trusted publisher before they can be executed.




                                         what are providers in powershell 
In PowerShell, a provider is a module or extension that allows you to interact with a particular data store, such as the file system, registry, or certificate store, using a consistent set of cmdlets and commands.

Providers in PowerShell are similar to drivers in an operating system. They act as an interface between PowerShell and a particular data store or resource, providing a set of cmdlets that can be used to manipulate and query that resource.

PowerShell includes several built-in providers, such as:

File system provider: allows you to navigate and manipulate files and directories on the local file system or network shares.
Registry provider: allows you to navigate and manipulate the Windows registry.
Certificate provider: allows you to work with X.509 certificates in the certificate store.
Environment provider: allows you to view and modify environment variables.
In addition to the built-in providers, you can also create your own custom providers to interact with other data stores or resources that are not supported by the built-in providers. This allows you to extend the functionality of PowerShell and create a consistent and easy-to-use interface for managing your systems and resources.

powershell command to find all  the drves in the pc
You can use the Get-PSDrive cmdlet in PowerShell to retrieve a list of all the drives available on your computer, including file system drives, registry drives, and others.

To find all the drives in your PC, open PowerShell and run the following command:

mathematica
Copy code
Get-PSDrive
This will display a list of all the drives on your computer, along with their drive letter, provider (i.e., the type of drive), root, and other details.

Note that some of the drives listed may be virtual or hidden drives that are not accessible in Windows Explorer.

and focus on line 81 , the certificate drive .
so what i can do is i can do a dir of certificate drive and i do tab completion here .
what i am doing is i am looking for a code signing search so the interesting thing is when i am in the sertificate 
drive i can do recurse on any frive of course but i can say give me the codesigning cert then i say outputvariable a 
$ dir Cert:\CurrentUser -Recurse -Codesigningcert -Outputvariable a 
and what it did was  it got me did a recursive search found me my codesigning certs 
i now put thenm in $a and then what i am gonna say is $cert = $a[0]
got a particular codesigning cset so now  let me get my execuion policy 
here you can its remote signed here i am gonna change that .


            PS C:\Users\rekha> Get-ExecutionPolicy
            RemoteSigned
            PS C:\Users\rekha>


press  ctrl + space button when you see the atocompletion to see the magic .
