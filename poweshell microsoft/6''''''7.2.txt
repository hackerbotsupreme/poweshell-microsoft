get-service | where{$_.status -eq "running"}
now here where{$_ this portion holds the object  and 
-eq this one is implying equals .
you can say why its -eq then why not eq.
bcz it got a lot of reasons .
and you can also find these typing--> get-help *comparison*
or you can say --> get-help *operators*
you are gonna see a lot of them 
get-service | where{$_.status -eq "running"}
here we can also say this like 
get-service | where{$PSItem.status -eq "running"}
and we can also extend this even further like 
get-service | where{$PSItem.status -eq "running" -and $_.name -like "b*"}
now with this line we are also been able to filter out data like here all the running functions that starts with b.



get-stuff | sort| where -somestuff | out-filter
get-stuff | where -somestuff | sort |out-file 
what do you think is the best performing way to write this ?
if you think about what is happening here , it does matter where you filter and where you sort. 
refer to this as you filter as far left as you posiibly can and you gonna see examples 
where the where object may not be the filter that's furthest left as a matter of fact you see some cool examples
