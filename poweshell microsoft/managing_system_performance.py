# Network Interface (Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller)\Bytes Total/Sec: This metric measures the rate at which data is sent and received over the network interface provided by the Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller. A value of 0 indicates that there is currently no data being transmitted or received.

# Real-world Application: This metric is crucial for monitoring network activity. In a real-world scenario, if you were downloading a large file from the internet, this value would increase as data is received, indicating network activity.

# Critical Points: This metric is related to monitoring network performance. A high value here could suggest heavy network usage or potential issues if data transfer rates are much lower than expected.

# Network Interface (Intel[R] Dual Band Wireless-AC 3168)\Bytes Total/Sec: Similar to the previous metric, this measures the rate of data transmission and reception, but specifically for the Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 3168 network interface.

# Real-world Application: In a scenario where you're streaming a high-definition video wirelessly, this metric would reflect the data transfer rate over the wireless network.

# Critical Points: It helps monitor the performance of wireless network connectivity. A constant 0 value might indicate a network problem or that the network interface is not in use.

# Processor(_Total)% Processor Time: This metric shows the percentage of time the processor is actively executing instructions. In this case, it's the overall processor usage on the system.

# Real-world Application: If you're running CPU-intensive tasks like video editing, the processor time will be high, indicating heavy CPU usage.

# Critical Points: High values can indicate a CPU bottleneck, where the processor is struggling to keep up with tasks, potentially leading to system slowdowns.

# Memory% Committed Bytes in Use: This metric represents the percentage of committed memory in use. Committed memory is the total memory that the operating system has promised to back with either physical RAM or pagefile space.

# Real-world Application: When your system has many applications open simultaneously, this metric can show how much of your available memory is actively being used.

# Critical Points: A high percentage here suggests that your system is using a significant portion of its memory, which can slow down performance if it approaches 100%.

# Memory\Cache Faults/Sec: This metric measures the rate at which the operating system is unable to find data in the cache memory and needs to fetch it from slower storage, such as RAM or disk.

# Real-world Application: High cache faults per second can indicate that the system is frequently accessing data from slower storage, which can impact overall system responsiveness.

# Critical Points: An excessively high rate of cache faults may signify a memory management issue or insufficient RAM for the applications running.

# PhysicalDisk(_Total)% Disk Time: This metric shows the percentage of time the physical disk is busy servicing read or write requests.

# Real-world Application: In a scenario where you're copying large files or installing software, the disk time will be high as the disk is actively engaged in these tasks.

# Critical Points: A consistently high disk time can indicate that the disk is a performance bottleneck, and the system may benefit from an upgrade to a faster storage device or reducing disk-intensive tasks.

# PhysicalDisk(_Total)\Current Disk Queue Length: This metric represents the number of requests that are currently waiting in the queue to be processed by the physical disk.

# Real-world Application: If you're performing multiple disk-intensive operations simultaneously, such as downloading large files while running a virus scan, this metric can show the depth of the disk queue.

# Critical Points: A long queue length, especially when combined with high disk time, can suggest that the disk is struggling to keep up with the demand, potentially leading to delays in accessing data.

# Best Practices:

# Monitor these performance metrics regularly to identify issues and optimize system performance.
# Understand the baseline values for your specific system to detect deviations.
# Use these metrics to troubleshoot and diagnose performance problems.
# Consider upgrading hardware components if certain metrics consistently indicate performance bottlenecks.
# Use specialized monitoring tools for more in-depth analysis and historical data tracking.

# what is event logs 

# ChatGPT
# Event logs are a vital component of the Windows operating system (OS) and many other computer systems. They serve as a record of events and activities that occur on a computer or server. These logs provide valuable information for system administrators, support personnel, and security professionals to monitor, troubleshoot, and analyze the performance, security, and behavior of a computer system
# Categories of Event Logs: On a Windows system, you typically find several categories of event logs, including:

# Application Log: This log records events generated by applications and programs running on the system. It may contain error messages, software installation events, and application-specific information.
# System Log: The system log contains events related to the operation of the operating system itself. It records system errors, hardware failures, and driver issues.
# Security Log: The security log is crucial for monitoring security-related events. It records login attempts, user authentication, permission changes, and other security-related activities.
# Setup Log: The setup log keeps track of events during the installation of Windows or software updates.
# Forwarded Events: In networked environments, forwarded events can be collected from multiple computers and stored centrally for analysis.
# Custom Logs: Administrators can create custom logs to record specific events or activities that are relevant to their system or applications.


# Get-WinEvent	
# Gets events from event logs and event tracing log files on local and remote computers.

# New-WinEvent	
# Creates a new Windows event for the specified event provider.

# powershell command to manage system performance  

# PowerShell provides a number of commands that can be used to manage system performance. Here are some examples:

# Get-Counter: This command allows you to monitor and track system performance metrics such as CPU usage, disk I/O, and network traffic. You can use it to collect performance data over a specified period of time and store it in a file for analysis.

# Get-Process: This command allows you to view information about running processes on the system, including CPU usage, memory usage, and other performance metrics. You can use it to identify processes that are consuming excessive system resources and take appropriate action.

# Get-WmiObject: This command allows you to retrieve information about the system using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). You can use it to gather information about system hardware and software, as well as monitor system performance.

# Set-ExecutionPolicy: This command allows you to control the execution of PowerShell scripts on the system. You can use it to restrict the execution of scripts to trusted sources and prevent malicious scripts from running on the system.

# Get-EventLog: This command allows you to view system event logs, which can provide insight into system performance issues and errors. You can use it to identify problems and take corrective action.

# These are just a few examples of PowerShell commands that can be used to manage system performance. There are many more available, depending on your specific needs and requirements.
