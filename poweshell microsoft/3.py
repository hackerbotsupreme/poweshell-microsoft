# we will learn about the needed fundamentals of networkng for cmd 
# what is cmd / cmd.exe ? 



# but before that what actually are .exe files 
#.EXE is a file extension used for executable files on the Windows operating system. An executable file is a program that can be run or executed on a computer system.
#When you double-click on an .EXE file, it launches a program or an installer. The program could be anything from a simple calculator to a complex software application, while the installer is a program that installs another program or software on your computer.
#.EXE files are commonly used on Windows-based computers and are known to be the primary way for viruses to infect a computer system. Therefore, it is important to download .EXE files only from trusted sources and to use antivirus software to scan them before opening them


# any operating system works with two interfaces . 1} CLI/CUI(COMMAND LINE INTERFACE /CHARECTER USER INTERFACE ) 2} GUI(GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE ) 
# WHAT ARE THE MAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CLI AND GUI 

# CLI (Command Line Interface) and GUI (Graphical User Interface) are two different types of user interfaces for interacting with a computer system.

# CLI refers to a text-based interface where the user interacts with the computer by typing commands into a terminal or console. It usually requires a good knowledge of commands and syntax to use effectively. CLI is often used for system administration tasks, programming and other tasks that require precise control.

# On the other hand, GUI refers to a graphical interface that allows users to interact with a computer system through graphical elements such as icons, buttons, windows, and menus. It is designed to be more user-friendly and intuitive than CLI. GUI is typically used for general computing tasks such as web browsing, email, multimedia, and gaming.

# The main differences between CLI and GUI are:

# Input Method: CLI requires the user to type commands using a keyboard, while GUI allows users to interact with the system through a mouse or touch screen.

# Learning Curve: CLI requires more knowledge of commands and syntax, making it more challenging for beginners, while GUI is typically more user-friendly and easier to learn.

# Speed and Efficiency: CLI is generally faster and more efficient for performing specific tasks once the user is familiar with the commands, while GUI is typically slower and less efficient for repetitive or complex tasks.

# Flexibility: CLI allows for more precise control over system settings and configurations, while GUI is typically more limited in terms of customization options.

# In summary, CLI and GUI are two different user interfaces that are suited for different types of tasks. CLI is generally more powerful and flexible, while GUI is more user-friendly and intuitive.


# IN Simple words  , everything that you can see on your monitor is gui .
# on the other hand , for clicui(command line interface  / charecter user interface ) we have a terminal where we need to type commands to perform any task by the system . 


# there are  two softwares (mostly .exe files ) comes inbuilt with the windows os  , the softwares which comes inbuilt/embedded with the os called system software .
    # oh so then are softwares are .exe files ?
    # is softwares are .exe files 
    #Not all software programs are .exe files, but many software programs for Windows operating system are .exe files.
    #An .exe file is an executable file, which means it contains the instructions that a computer needs to run a program. It is typically used for programs that run on Windows, although other operating systems may also use executable files with different extensions.
    #However, there are many software programs that are not distributed as .exe files. For example, some programs are distributed as a zip file, which contains multiple files including an executable file, while others may be distributed as an installer file with an .msi or .dmg extension.
    #Additionally, not all programs require installation, and may be run directly from the file itself without being installed on the system.
    #So, while .exe files are a common type of software program for Windows, they are not the only type, and software can come in various formats depending on the operating system and how it is distributed.
    
    # and also what are system softwares
    # System software refers to a group of software programs that manage and control the basic operations of a computer system. These programs are essential to the functioning of the computer and its hardware components.
    # Some examples of system software include:
    # Operating Systems (OS): This is the core system software that manages the computer's hardware resources, provides a user interface, and runs other software programs. Examples of operating systems include Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    # Device drivers: These are software programs that allow the operating system to communicate with and control hardware devices, such as printers, scanners, and video cards.
    # Firmware: This is software that is permanently programmed into the hardware devices of a computer system, such as the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface).
    # Utility programs: These are software programs that perform specific tasks related to system maintenance and management, such as disk defragmentation, antivirus software, and backup programs.
    # Programming tools: These are software programs that are used to create and develop other software programs, such as compilers, debuggers, and text editors.
    # Overall, system software is the backbone of a computer system, providing the necessary functionality to manage and control the various hardware components, and allowing users to run other software programs.

    # and the last one is what are the difference between embed and inbuilt 
    # The terms "embed" and "inbuilt" are related to the integration of one thing within another. However, they have slightly different meanings:
    # "Embed" means to insert or place one thing within another so that it becomes an integral part of it. The thing that is embedded is usually a separate object or component that is added to enhance or extend the functionality of the object it is embedded in. For example, a video that is embedded in a webpage, or a chart that is embedded in a report.
    # "Inbuilt" means something that is already built-in or integrated within something else, such as a feature, function or capability that is already present within a system or product, without the need for any additional components or modifications. For example, a smartphone camera is an inbuilt feature of the phone, whereas a camera that is attached to the phone externally would be considered an embedded component.
    # So, the main difference between "embed" and "inbuilt" is that "embed" implies adding a separate component to something else to enhance its functionality, whereas "inbuilt" refers to something that is already integrated or built-in to a system or product without the need for additional components.
# which are cmd  and powershell.
# we can do a bunch of stuff using cmd .. such as check the ping , file managing , editing in storage etc etc. 
# a special use-case of cmd is we can delete those file which came embedded or inbuilt with the system and create a backdoor to the nictim's system and hack their system remotely . with that , 
# a special use-case of powershell  is that we canuse it in networking/ hacking . 
    #what does ping checks 
    #Ping is a network utility tool that is used to test the connectivity between two network devices, such as a computer and a server. It sends a small data packet called an "echo request" to the device and waits for a response, called an "echo reply".
    # Ping checks a few different things, including:
    # Connectivity: Ping is often used to test if a device on the network is reachable and responsive. If the device responds to the ping, it indicates that the network connection is working properly.
    # Latency: Ping measures the time it takes for the data packet to travel from the sender to the recipient and back again. This is known as latency or round-trip time. A higher latency can indicate network congestion or a slow connection.
    # Packet Loss: Ping can also detect packet loss, which occurs when a data packet is lost during transmission. If the sender does not receive an echo reply, it indicates that the data packet was lost or dropped somewhere on the network.
    # Ping is a simple and widely-used tool for network troubleshooting and monitoring. It can be used to diagnose network problems, test connectivity and latency, and verify that a device or server is operational.
